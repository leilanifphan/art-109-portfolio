    <!-- UPDATE THIS PARAGRAPH -->
    <p>I chose to redesign the book cover of "Crying in HMart" by Michelle Zauner. In "Crying in HMart", Michelle Zauner
        discusses her relationship with food before her mother's passing. Michelle poses a struggles with her
        relationship with food as I highlighted on the front cover with some common Korean dishes.</p>
